    <p>This is a kickstart for scratch where one moves a girl to the fruit. It contains basic procedures to help with future types of games. Few scripts implanted in this game, were randommoveto(X,Y) and the addition and subtraction of X/Y.</p>

    <p>Pretty simple concept of a game were one just dodge all the projectiles. Overtime the object move and duplicate making it harder and harder. Major elements in this game was CLONING and randommoveto(X,Y). </p>

	  <p>It starts out with you waking up on the first day of your high school senior year. You decides to either wake up or go back to sleep which will lead to a another timeline. As the story progress, if options are chosen properly, a fight with the principal shall commence. Our whole story uses only if/else
	  for the mulitple choice with a or b as its option. A makor problem we had was to manually reset the whole story if failure to type a or b. I felt that the story could been for vivid or longer to entertain the audience even more
	  On the day of the gallery walk, one story I admire was the one that delayed for each line of text so the reader can be more immerse. I wish we had actually made the story more interesting by increasing the length of the story.</p>
